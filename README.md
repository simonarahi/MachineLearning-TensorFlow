# MachineLearning-TensorFlow
Two Classification Problems Using Tensorflow and Keras:
1. Paintings Classification: trained a Convolutional Neural Network to guess which artist of the Impressionist period painted the painting
2. Traffic Accident Classification (latest_ML.ipynb): trained a CNN to predict the severity of the accident injury
